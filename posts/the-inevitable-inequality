# The Inevitable Inequality: A Path of Individual Empowerment

The modern economic cycle is not something that we can expect to reverse. We, as a society, are faced with a constant churn of new money entering our system and in an unregulated system such as the modern state there will almost certainly be an increase to inequality between those who "have", and those who "have not". If you understand the dynamic of newly made funds, it should become no surprise when this inevitably happens with all implementations to change a cycle using only systems-based approaches. It will become an economic and painful process, unless something else gives for people to thrive.

## The Problem With New Money

Anytime new money enters an economic system, it almost guaranteed to create division: enriching the few who have access or positions that benefit from initial expansion (early capital ownership/property investment and expansion of existing investment positions), and thus widening the wealth gap and thus increasing income inequality. Attempts to control the amount of "new money" will have cascading effects like decreased activity. Slower economic activity means fewer jobs and stagnated pay, disproportionately impacting those struggling to get by on their next check. A slowed system often leaves those least prepared for those issues (and living pay-check to pay check) left to bare the greatest costs.

While it may slow inequality from rising through slowing expansion on 'new money' those are seldom equal in consequence with no true system-based 'rebalance'. Those in "power" still have more than the average person and these types of systemic approaches that impact the economy only slow an inequality shift at all levels and not a net decrease in overall income inequality over time (those at the top can always find better and less painful means to work in slower markets compared to an individual seeking "balance" by trying to only keep a system approach to their problems), as the consequences fall more dramatically to a smaller end at those struggling the most with the basic needs as their work places reduce cost (lower staffing), pay rate and cut general support of the individual to help support it through such times. It doesn't work as simply 'as balance' between power (with no system-based changes), and that means there are many implications.

## Society Cannot Solve This – But Individuals Can

It is highly likely our society (governments, banks etc) may not create a solution as we understand basic 'human nature' makes people seek progress and build a better path (and usually to include an 'excess'). No one will intentionally create less of that growth even if those around it suffer as human history as repeatedly demonstrated in such scenarios where power has leverage through growth and expansion by having access or the resources and means for this to happen. We cannot expect these people, administrations or systems to come to some consensus because the needs will never always intersect equally or align. Therefore we need an action-based plan. We need to address these problems from the 'I' based, using clear actionable solutions to manage personal economic and financial resources through this constant, yet unbalanced change. The key factor for you in this understanding comes when you acknowledge that **_only you_ can make changes based off actions by such larger economic and system processes**, so begin focusing time there instead of wasting effort on trying to 'fix' large unorganized macro system behaviors when your core concerns remain within your current sphere of control and the sphere that dictates your most basic levels of living conditions.

**The Individual's Strategy: Steps You *Can* Control**

What is the goal of this path in action that we as individuals should begin with in a 'personal' approach to economics and wealth generation:

1.  **Increase Income:** Seek additional revenue streams, skill expansion, or career advancement opportunities to earn a living at its fullest capacity using talent, resources and knowledge gained over the years. Your time must have proper direction to make change.
2.  **Increase Savings:** Develop methods to retain and build wealth/financial cushions using intentional planning. Begin thinking of income not only as a monthly process, but yearly ones as an individual. 
3.  **Lower Expenses:** Streamline financial burdens, obligations or "leaks" by intentional spending decisions by considering how purchases change an overall yearly approach to value of life based on resource access and capacity. Don't live for the 'next month', use your earnings at current position and 'future' possible value, strategically based on knowledge.
4.  **Strategic Investments:** Position personal holdings so capital begins to flow out and compound at levels or placements that resonate in goals while allowing opportunity to reduce expenses or lower labor demands for its users. Consider options such as property or long-term asset/position ownership so your income expands while building your foundations

It must become a main goal for an individual is to use personal economic planning that does not prioritize buying into constant luxuries as this further extends the cycle that reinforces income inequalities (the 'reason'). That initial drive towards luxury to celebrate effort simply creates further divisions as people's money only compounds existing systems and doesn't have much direct individual reward when implemented poorly. A conscious redirection of priorities makes a far deeper positive long-term difference as we build foundational value vs short term gains with zero impact to core systems (and often make them worse through continuous input for growth by expansion that do little for personal freedom long term in these areas). We also become empowered at personal levels when these elements begin resonating in positive methods

## Expect Nothing From the System, But You May Control How it Effects You

Instead of looking toward governmental or macro forces, individuals should expect *nothing*. Their role will likely be of minimal change and might inadvertently become much worse (intention does not mean result) through external actions due to how decisions might ripple into all levels and sectors of markets (many not having a full understanding for the total implications to all users equally). Your understanding of existing systems that govern a given marketplace must become tools used to leverage change through planning. Recognize that all your goals come from your efforts as no external agent has a responsibility to fulfill your own personal goals (and this is a critical lesson of 'self reliance' within those goals). What other decisions they will be making is always unknown to others at levels that cannot affect change in outcome so time spent trying to analyze systems you can't control can be seen as an expense you should cut from your time allocations

We can leverage their system changes as insight for more effective means in implementing action toward your financial self reliance. That understanding becomes the foundation in what you learn through the channel to make effective change and long term goals and personal happiness through self ownership, through practical actions and building knowledge with other like minded peers. We at TheIndependentHome are about what is practical and achievable and the 'here and now' and offer resources that aid such change as our goal remains to unlock these possibilities, not simply just discuss them, within realistic implementations as life progresses. This is an investment towards 'future value' as a resource of self governance and 'independent living' instead of hoping for a system-based plan that simply wont come for all due to fundamental core mechanics, it is built using a long term application of value within individuals.

This journey that requires change begins with accepting things as is (using it as the first layer towards future goal), while you focus what control *you* possess on a long-term foundation build of values, instead of temporary solutions with external dependency that you *can't* control.
